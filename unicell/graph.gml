    comment "Note that this class was re-labeled to 'cultured cell' instead of 'cell line cell', as it intent was clarified to cover any cultured cells of multicellular and unicellular organisms. This includes cells actively being cultured, or cells that have been cultured but are stored in a quiescent state for future use. In having been cultured, cells must establish homeostasis and often replicate in a foreign environment. Accomodation of this stress initiates a selection of cells fit for such challenges, wherein necessary adaptive biochemical and.or genetic changes can occur. These changes can set them apart from the in vivo cells from which they derive, and such changes will typically accumulate and change over increasing time in culture."

As ions, nutrients, and liquid enter the lens from the aqueous humor, Na+/K+ ATPase pumps in the lens epithelial cells pump ions out of the lens to maintain appropriate lens osmolarity and volume, with equatorially positioned lens epithelium cells contributing most to this current. The activity of the Na+/K+ ATPases keeps water and current flowing through the lens from the poles and exiting through the equatorial regions. The cells of the lens epithelium also serve as the progenitors for new lens fibers. It constantly lays down fibers in the embryo, fetus, infant, and adult, and continues to lay down fibers for lifelong growth.&#34; [GOC:tfm, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_%28anatomy%29#Lens_epithelium, ISBN:0721662544]"

These cells also have numerous irregular apical microvilli compared with the surrounding segment-specific cells. Intercalated cells lack a central cilium, at least in the cortex, which also differentiates them from the adjacent principal cells."

    comment "From FMA: 9.07.2001: Endothelial cell has always been classified as a kind of epithelial cell, specifically a squamous cell but that is not true. First, endothelial cell can either be squamous or cuboidal (e.g. high-endothelial cell) and secondly, it has different embryological derivation (mesodermal) than a true epithelial cell (ectodermal and endodermal). The basis for present classification is the fact that it comprises the outermost layer or lining of anatomical structures (location-based) but a better structural basis for the differentia is the cytoskeleton of the cell. Endothelial cell has vimentin filaments while an epithelial cell has keratin filaments. [Onard]."

    comment "Like smooth muscle, a glomerular mesangial cell is contractile and possesses the filaments actin and myosin. The contractile mechanism is also similar to that of smooth muscle, with Ca2+/calmodulin-activated myosin light-chain kinase instigating myosin-actin cross-bridge cycling. Mesangial cell phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils involves a novel CD36-independent, alpha(v)beta3/TSP-mediated mechanism that is uncoupled from chemokine secretion, emphasizing the injury-limiting potential of mesangial cell phagocytosis of apoptotic cells."

    comment "In a consensus model of unidirectional secretion, aqueous humour is formed by transferring solute, principally NaCl, from stroma to posterior chamber, with water passively following the osmotic gradient. Unidirectional secretion comprises three sequential steps. First, NaCl is transferred from the stromal interstitium into the pigmented ciliary epithelial (PE) cells. Second, solute passes from the PE into the non-pigmented ciliary epithelial (NPE) cells through gap junctions. Finally, NPE cells release Na+ and Cl&#8722; into the aqueous humour."

    comment "It has been noted in at least some mammalian species that the urothelial basal cell type is distinguished by expression of high levels of cytokeratin-5 (CK5), p63 and the signalling molecule Sonic hedgehog (Shh). Similar to intermediate cells, the urothelial basal cell type expresses CK17 but is negative for uroplakins (UPK) and CK20. Urothelial basal cells have also been noted to be smaller in diameter than urothelial intermediate cells."

    comment "In a consensus model of unidirectional secretion, aqueous humour is formed by transferring solute, principally NaCl, from stroma to posterior chamber, with water passively following the osmotic gradient. Unidirectional secretion comprises three sequential steps. First, NaCl is transferred from the stromal interstitium into the pigmented ciliary epithelial (PE) cells. Second, solute passes from the PE into the non-pigmented ciliary epithelial (NPE) cells through gap junctions. Finally, NPE cells release Na+ and Cl&#8722; into the aqueous humour."

The layer of intermediate cells in the urothelium ranges from one to several layers thick depending on the species with intermediate cells attached to adjacent cell layers and one another via desmosomes.&#34; [doi:10.1038/s41385-022-00565-0]"
    comment "It has been noted in at least some mammalian species that the urothelial intermediate cell type is similar to basal cells by expressing CK17 and (unlike umbrella cells) p63 but is positive for uroplakins (UPK) and negative for CK5. Urothelial intermediate cells have also been noted to be larger in diameter than urothelial basal cells."

    def "&#34;A urothelial cell that is terminally differentiated and part of the urothelial apical surface that forms the high-resistance barrier of urothelium. Umbrella cells have been described as the largest of urothelial cell types, highly polarized, and, in some species, multinucleated. In the relaxed state, these cells form a dome-shaped structure at the apical pole and can also cover multiple underlying intermediate cells, leading to the name umbrella cells. In contrast, these cells flatten when the bladder is filled.&#34; [doi:10.1038/s41385-022-00565-0]"
    comment "Umbrella cells are attached to sub-superficial cell layers via desmosomes, while tight junctions localized between superficial cells aid in forming a high-resistance barrier function. Another distinguishing feature of an umbrella cell type is the presence of subapical discoidal/fusiform-shaped vesicles contributing to the plasticity in urothelial cell surface area through a regulated process of endocytosis/exocytosis. It has been noted in at least some mammalian species that the urothelial umbrella cell type expresses UPK1A, UPK1B, UPK2 and UPK3A. Unlike intermediate and basal cells of the urothelium, CK17 is reported to be completely absent and p63 not expressed in umbrella cells."

    comment "This class encompasses the muscle cells responsible for heart* contraction in both vertebrates and arthropods.  The ultrastucture of a wide range of arthropod heart cells has been examined including spiders, horseshoe crabs, crustaceans (see Sherman, 1973 and refs therein) and insects (see Lehmacher et al (2012) and refs therein).  According to these refs, the cells participating in heart contraction in all cases are transversely striated.  Insects hearts additionally contain ostial cells, also transversely striated muscle cells, but which do not participate in heart contraction."

In Rhesus macaques, the RXFP1-positive interface island D1-medium spiny neuron (D1-NUDAP) has been noted to have upregulation of OPRM1 compared to DRD1-expressing medium spiny neurons located outside of the D1-exclusive island and in Islands of Calleja. Kappa-opioid receptor gene (OPRK1) has been noted to be absent from D1-NUDAP cells. Many striosome-specific markers have been noted to be upregulated in D1-NUDAP cells, including KCNIP1, KCNT1, KHDRBS3, and BACH2. PDYN, an acknowledged D1-striosome marker gene, has also been noted to be expressed in D1-NUDAPs. D1-NUDAPs also express some genes found to be selectively expressed in the matrix, including STXBP6, GDA, and SEMA3E. Gene enrichment analysis has revealed that D1-NUDAP neurons express genes that have been implicated in drug addiction and many other functions."

It has been noted in at least one study that an eccentric MSN differs in expression from direct and indirect MSNs by 110 genes (more than the 68 that distinguished direct and indirect spiny projection neurons from each other) and expresses many genes that have little expression in the rest of the striatum. It also has been noted in at least one human study that most eccentric MSNs expressed only DRD1, but many in the basal ganglia co-expressed DRD1 and DRD2, suggesting regional specialization of a more broadly distributed cell type."

While the L5 ET neuron projections are not limited to ET targets, they are clearly differentiated from the neuron subclasses whose projections are constrained to intratelencephalic (IT) targets.  L5 ET neurons are generally the largest excitatory cortical neurons, typically having a thick apical dendrite with a prominent dendritic tuft in layer 1 and displaying burst-firing physiological characteristics.&#34; [DOI:10.1101/2020.10.19.343129]"

    comment "KNDy neurons are involved in the negative feedback of gonadotropin-releasing hormone release in the hypothalamic&#8211;pituitary&#8211;gonadal axis. Sex steroids released from the gonads act on KNDy neurons as inhibitors of kisspeptin release. This inhibition provides negative feedback control on the hypothalamic&#8211;pituitary&#8211;gonadal axis. Other roles of KNDy neurons include influences on prolactin production; puberty; stress' effects on reproduction; and the control of thermoregulation."
